## Using .NET to Create an Electronic Prescription System

This project is designed to address and correct issues which exist in the healthcare industry today. The main aim is to make the prescription process easier for Doctors, Pharmacists and Patients by providing applications which handle the documentation and communication aspects of prescriptions electronically.

The applications are built using Microsoft’s .NET framework, Oracle’s Database Architecture and Xamarin’s cross-platform development software. This allows applications to be deployed on platforms which target a wide range of users while sharing code between platforms. Users can expect similar designs across all supported hardware, which makes it easy to switch between desktop, mobile and tablet versions of the applications while keeping their data up-to-date.
